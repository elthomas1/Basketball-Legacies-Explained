    <h3>Career Statistics</h3>
    <p>18.2 ppg 4.5 rpg 9.5 ast 2.1 spg</p>
    <h3>Report</h3>
    <p>Cp3 might be the most talented all around pg in nba history this side of Isaih Thomas, and John Stockton. A true point guard with virtually no flaws in his game on either side of the floor. Offensvily he is a showcase basketball brilliance. His ball handling is superb, tight and conventional. He lacks in size only being 6 ft 185 lbs and not a explosive athlete. But he makes up for it with his baketball IQ, and passion for making the right plays either for hinself or his teamates. A balanced attacker, his mobility, and handle allows him to work both side to side, and down hill. His bread and butter is the mid pick and roll where he can maneuver himself to his spots for open looks or find the open roll man for lobs,  or kick out to an open shooter. As a scorer, he prfers to utilize ball screens to get to his favorite spots on the floor, the right and left elbows. His is one of the most accurate and prolific mid range shooters the game has ever seen. In his younger years he was able to get down hull abd finish at the rim using a wide variety of floaters, runners, and acrobatic moves to evade bigger defenders in traffic, shooting at above average rate of 50% at the rim. As a 3pt shooter, he has gotten better and better as the years have prpgrrssed. ONce being an average shooter, and now being one of the better shooters, topping off at a creer best 41 percent. But the thing that makes him stand out on offense is his playmaking. Utilizing a wide varietty of passing types, and being  such a precise passer, he bolsters one of the best ast/tvr ratios in history at 4:1. He rarely makes the wrong decsion or makes a lazy pass. Defensively he is feisty, strong for his size, and has some of the quickest hands ever. Being top 10 all time in steals and spg, while leading the league in that stat a record six times. </p>
    <h3>Legacy and Impact on the Game</h3>

    <img src="img/Bulls-Player-Artis-Gilmore-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>Career Statistics</h3>
    <p>18.8 ppg 12.3 rpg 2.4 bpg</p>
    <h3>Report</h3>
    <p>A quintessential bigman of the previous era. Very similar in style to that of Wilt. A mountain of a man, standing 7 ft 1, weighing 240 lbs, Artis Gilmore was an absolute unit on the floor. He was lauded as arguably the second or third strongest man to ever grace the hardwood. His physicality, atheticim, and sixe allowed for him to wreck shop down low as a servicable offenivse option, and a disruptuive defensive force. Alot of his better years came in the ABA beofe later joining the NBA after the merging of the two associations. He want the most versatile offensive player, but he  had a reliable post hook, and a 5-10 ft jumper that allowed hin to be an above average talent on that end.  The main fixation for him was rebounding and dunking. With a ridiculous effiecy at the rim, having several seasons over 60% from the field, anything withing a foot of the basket was easy money. Defnsively he used his length and unearthly strength to punish anyone who dared to challenge him under the basket. </p>
    <h3>Legacy and Impact on the Game</h3>
    <p>One of the best players who tansfered from the ABA-NBA merger. One of the players from the pre modern era that was able to move into the modern era succesfully.</p>
